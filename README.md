🏙️ Crowd Density Classification using CNNs 🤖
Welcome to the Crowd Density Classification project! 🚀 This repository contains two powerful CNN-based models designed to classify crowd density in images using the JHU-CROWD++ and ShanghaiTech datasets. 📷

📂 Project Overview
We provide deep learning solutions for crowd density estimation across two datasets:

JHU-CROWD++ Dataset 🏛️
Categorizes crowd images into three density levels based on head counts.
Utilizes convolutional neural networks with dropout and early stopping to enhance performance.
ShanghaiTech Dataset 🏢
Includes detailed head count data via ground truth annotations (.mat files).
Implements preprocessing, CNN training, and visualization.
🚀 Features
✨ End-to-End Pipeline: Image preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.
✨ CNN Architecture: Multi-layered convolutional networks optimized for crowd analysis.
✨ Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance.
✨ Learning Rate Reduction: Automatically adjusts learning rates to improve convergence.
✨ Visualization: Accuracy and loss graphs to track progress.
✨ Customizable: Modify dataset paths and parameters with ease.

⚙️ How to Run
1️⃣ Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crowd-density-classification.git
cd crowd-density-classification
2️⃣ Modify Dataset Paths
Update the dataset paths in the respective scripts before running:

python
Copy
Edit
# Example for JHU-CROWD++ dataset (in jhucrowdpp_cnn.py)
dataset_path = r"C:\JHU_CROWD++_DATASET\train\images"
labels_file_path = r"C:\JHU_CROWD++_DATASET\train\image_labels.txt"

# Example for ShanghaiTech dataset (in shanghaitech_cnn.py)
dataset_path = r"C:\shanghaitech\part_A\train_data\images"
ground_truth_path = r"C:\shanghaitech\part_A\train_data\ground-truth"
3️⃣ Train the Models 🏋️‍♂️
For JHU-CROWD++ Dataset:
bash
Copy
Edit
python JHU_CROWD++/jhucrowdpp_cnn.py
For ShanghaiTech Dataset:
bash
Copy
Edit
python ShanghaiTech/shanghaitech_cnn.py
4️⃣ Evaluate the Model 🧪
Once training is completed, the accuracy and loss metrics will be displayed.

5️⃣ Make Predictions 🔮
Test the trained model with a new image:

python
Copy
Edit
from cnn_model import predict_image

predicted_label = predict_image("cnn_model.h5", "test_image.jpeg")
print(f"Predicted Crowd Density Class: {predicted_label}")
